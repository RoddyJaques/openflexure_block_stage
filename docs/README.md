OpenFlexure Microscope
======================

This folder contains the documentation for the OpenFlexure Block Stage.  The editable files, issues, documentation, and more live in the [source repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_block_stage/).

Please don't just launch into printing the STL files in the STL folder.  You need different quantities of each one and there are some alternatives where you only need one out of a few different files.  See the readme in that folder for more details.

To read the assembly instructions, you need to transform the XML file into HTML.  The easiest way to do this is to [view it online](https://rwb27.github.io/openflexure_block_stage/docubricks/), directly from github.

This project is released under the CERN open hardware license, and was developed by Richard Bowman in 2014-17.
